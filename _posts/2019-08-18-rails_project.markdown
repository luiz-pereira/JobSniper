That is actually my second project. The first one was the conversion of the Sinatra Project into Rails. That tought me a lot, so this one here was pretty awesome, as I could use it as a test case for new stuff like bootstrap, file upload, etc.

The project front-end sucks!. But I am very proud of the back-end. It was a fantastic experience and I can tell I am much more versed in routes than before. Anxious to see what else is in the pipeline!
