The second project was challenging, but not in the same way as the first one. 

On the first one, the challenge was on coding and scraping the internet. Now the code was fairly straightforward, so the main issues were related to the user experience and how not to lose track of all the routes in sinatra.

I tried to be as RESTful as possible, but with many views/controllers and models, it was easy to lose track and get into some trouble when defining a new rout.

As for the user experience, Sinatra is amazing in terms of what it does behind the scenes, but the front-end was very tricky, considering the website is delivered through a static html. Every element that we're used to nowadays required a brand new route and some creative workarounds.

It was a challenging but rewarding experience, considering it was the first time I could deliver a product that i could possibly share with someone else and have a real usage in the outside world.

The experience was so good that I intend to bring the website live next week and improve it further.

Already anxious for the next challenge. Rais, bring it on!
