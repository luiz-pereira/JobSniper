As it is with all the projects, that's when I really learn and this one wasn't different. The lessons for react-redux were somehow boring (or it may just be me tired), so I struggled a lot to understand why the heck would I write 50 lines of code to do something I could do in 5 using Rails.

However, managing state with react makes a lot of sense, especially if you'll use the same component more than once or if you have a lot of similar components under one single container. These are not present in my App (coffee-hub), but I could see the value when doing my project.

My project is a market place for coffee producers and buyers (Business buyers to be clear). You would see all the coffees available and ask for a tasting. After that you'll be able to make purchases of the coffee for your company through the website.

It took way more work than I expected, but it was basically all my fault. I have the awful habit of setting my expectations too high. Anyway, it was a good closure for the bootcamp, even though I'm not incredibly happy with the result (I guess no one ever really is), but It served its purpose of learning react/redux/api/async thunk. etc.

On a side note, I though I would be happier to end this adventure that was the bootcamp, but NO! I miss my lessons already:(. I just hope I can still maintain the same discipline in the next months, so I can keep improving and move my career definitively to the wonderful world of coding!
