And things start to take shape... I finally feel like I am a Full-stack!! a lousy one... but a Full-stack!!

My project consisted in optimizing the user experience  on one of my rails projects (jobsniper.ca), by removing a bunch of useless pages and redirects_to.

The big upside of my new project comes from the asynchronous request I was able to include. That's amazing!! I can refresh a bunch of APIs, without annoying the user with lengthy processes, it makes all the difference in the world in terms of user experience. 

My intention is to improve the design (which is awful) and bring it up live again!

Almost done...!
